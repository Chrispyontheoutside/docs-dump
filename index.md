## **Using The Clusters**
### **QuickStart Guides:**
For just the "need-to-know" information on getting started with our
clusters, visit our QuickStart pages. Topics discussed include cluster
access, file management, the batch system, setting up a software
environment using modules, creating your own job files, and project
account management. [FASTER Quickstart Guide](/kb3/User-Guides/Grace/Grace@QuickStart/), [Grace Quickstart Guide](/kb3/User-Guides/Grace/Grace@QuickStart/), [Terra Quickstart Guide](/kb3/User-Guides/Terra/Terra@QuickStart/).

###  **Batch Jobs:** 
As a shared resource between many users, each cluster must employ a batch system to schedule a time for each user's job to run. Without such a system, one user could use a disproportionate amount of resources, and cause other users' work to stall. Grace's and Terra's batch system is called SLURM. Information relevant to each system can be found below.

Creating your own batch jobs: the [tamubatch Page](/kb3/Helpful-Pages/tamubatch/SW@tamubatch/) provides information on
how to use tamubatch to create and submit jobs easily.

> -   **Troubleshooting:** While we cannot predict all bugs and errors,
> 	some issues on our clusters are common enough to catalog. See the
> 	[Common Problems and Quick Solutions Page](/kb3/FAQ/HPRC@CommonProblems@Accounts/) for a small
> 	collection of the most prevalent issues. For further assistance,
> 	users can contact **help@hprc.tamu.edu** to open a support
> 	ticket.
