## Choosing Which Machine Learning Software to Use

With the variety of machine learning tools available on the clusters, it
is important to choose the one which is best suited to the needs of your
project. Most of these tools are libraries built on top of Python, so
familiarity with Python could influence your decision on which to use.
Some packages are better suited for GPU use. Below is a list of machine
learning tools available on the clusters along with information about
them.

  - [ Keras](/kb3/Software/Keras/SW@Keras/ "wikilink") - Keras is a minimalist, highly
    modular neural networks library, written in Python and capable of
    running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano.
  - [ PyTorch](/kb3/Software/PyTorch/SW:PyTorch/ "wikilink") - Tensors and Dynamic neural
    networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration.
  - [ Scikit-Learn](/kb3/Software/Scikit-Learn/SW@Scikit_Learn/ "wikilink") - An open-source python
    library for data mining and data analysis. Built on NumPy, SciPy,
    and matplotlib.
  - [ TensorFlow](/kb3/Software/TensorFlow/SW@TensorFlow/ "wikilink") - An open-source python
    library for Machine Intelligence
  - [ Caffe](/kb3/Software/Caffe/SW@CAFFE/ "wikilink") - A modular deep learning framework
  - [ Faster-RCNN using Tensorflow](/kb3/Software/Faster-RCNN/SW@Faster-RCNN/ "wikilink") - Faster
    R-CNN is an object detection framework based on deep convolutional
    networks, which includes a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and an
    Object Detection Network. Both networks are trained for sharing
    convolutional layers for fast testing.

## Python

The [ Python](/kb3/Software/Python/SW@Python/ "wikilink") is a useful page for learning how to
load Python and set up a virtual environment, which may be necessary
when installing additional packages/libraries. Note that not every
version of Python will be compatible with your chosen machine learning
tool. It is important to be aware of the limitations of the package
which you are using.

## Anaconda

[ Anaconda](/kb3/Software/ANACONDA/SW@Anaconda/ "wikilink") is a distribution of Python aimed at
simplifying package management. Anaconda can also create virtual
environments, and may provide a better approach for usage of machine
learning tools.
