# GCATools
GCATools (Genomic Computational Analysis Tools) is a suite of scripts gathered from the web and others developed by TAMU HPRC staff.

```php
module load GCATools/1.0
```

The following scripts are available:

```php
assemblathon_stats.pl      # show assembly stats for a genome build (from https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics/assemblathon2-analysis)
cmd_compare_builds.pl      # compare builds of two or more assemblies (uses assemblathon_stats.pl)
cmd_parse_contigs.pl       # print scaffolds/contigs longer than a specified minimum length.
```
After loading the GCATools module, run any script with -h to see the help documentation
