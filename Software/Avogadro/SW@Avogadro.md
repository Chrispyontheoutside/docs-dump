## Access

### Running Avogadro in the Portal

Avogadro is available on Grace as a singularity container which must be
executed on compute nodes.  
It is suggested to run Avogadro using VNC implemented under [Interactive
Apps](/kb3/Software/Portal/SW@Portal/#interactive-apps/) in the
[Portal](/kb3/Software/Portal/SW@Portal/).  
When the portal VNC terminal is started, use the following commands to
launch Avogadro.

#### Grace

To load a particular version of Avogadro on Grace:

` [ netID@cluster ~]$ `**`ml   Avogadro/1.2.0`**

To launch VMD:

` [ netID@cluster ~]$ `**`avogadro`**

#### Terra

This section will be updated when Avogadro is available on Terra.
