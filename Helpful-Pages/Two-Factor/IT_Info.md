# Two-Factor Authentication Requirement

Starting October 1, 2018, the Division of Information Technology will require use of Duo NetID Two Factor Authentication on its Virtual Private Network (VPN) (connect.tamu.edu) service.

Duo provides a second layer of security to Texas A&M accounts.


If you are not already enrolled in Duo and plan to use VPN, you can enroll now at duo.tamu.edu. Enrolling is as easy as 1-2-3:

1. Choose your device and download the Duo Mobile app. (We strongly recommend the mobile app as the most user-friendly option.)

2. Start your enrollment at https://gateway.tamu.edu/duo-enroll/;

3. Remember: Once you sign up, you will need your Duo-enrolled device when you log in to most Texas A&M resources.
