# LMS

Welcome to the Laboratory for Molecular Simulation

## Description

High Performance Research Computing's Laboratory for Molecular
Simulation (LMS) is Texas A&M University's core user facility for
molecular modeling. It is supported by user contributions and by the
Office of the Vice President for Research, College of Science, College
of Engineering/TEES, and College of Agriculture & Life Sciences. The
mission of the LMS is to bring molecular modeling closer to the
experimental scientist by offering training to both new and advanced
users. Cutting edge molecular modeling software is available through the
LMS to perform quantum calculations on "small" molecular or solid
systems and molecular mechanics/dynamics modeling for large systems such
as proteins, DNA, nanomolecules, polymers, solids, and liquids. The LMS
is also committed to expanding the incorporation of molecular modeling
into TAMU university undergraduate and graduate courses by providing
support for faculty that wish to incorporate molecular modeling into
their course material.
