# Project Reports

At the end of any Startup or Research allocation, a short summary report
must be submitted to the allocation committee (see below for desired
report content). Failure to submit this report may be used in the
consideration of future allocations.

The report should be a maximum of 5 pages and should include the
following information:

  - Principal user information \[PI\] (name, status, department, phone,
    email, institution \[if different from TAMU\]
  - Summarize the TAMU-sponsored research in a non-technical fashion,
    suitable for public consumption. (maximum two pages)
  - Publications and other research products
  - Describe any potential applications of the research to industry or
    government.
  - Describe any use of this allocation to encourage education in
    computational science, and particularly the level of student
    involvement and any HPRC elements incorporated into formal courses.
