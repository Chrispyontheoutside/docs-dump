# Add a Project Delegate

The PI of a Research or Startup project can add one delegate to transfer
SUs to/from researchers of that project. A delegate of a project must be
a researcher of that project. For example, a PI has a Research project
080123456789 with three researchers: Tom, Mary, and Gabriel. The PI can
add one researcher (e.g. Mary) to be the delegate of this project. After
Mary is added as the project delegate, Mary can transfer SUs from the
PI's account to Tom's account and vice versa.

1.  PI needs to login at <https://hprc.tamu.edu/ams>
