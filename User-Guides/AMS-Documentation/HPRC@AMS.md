## Storage Options

**Google Drive**

Google Drive provides TAMU users with dedicated storage. To transfer
files from HPRC to Google Drive see [rclone](/kb3/Software/rclone-(Cloud-Backup)/SW@rclone/ "wikilink") page.

**Microsoft OneDrive**

Microsoft OneDrive provides 5TB for TAMU users. To see how to transfer
files from Grace/Terra to OneDrive please follow [Globus
Connect](/--Software/#globusconnect "wikilink") page.

**HPRC Long Term Storage**

TAMU HPRC can provide dedicated storage in longer term for a cost. The
rate for Grace storage is $130/TB for 5 years based on the pure hardware
cost. The new storage has 5-year warranty, so the rate is $26/TB per
year. HPRC has subsidized all other operation costs. Most research
computing centers or cloud companies would charge over $100/TB/year. You
can buy in some dedicated storage for you and your group to use if you
like. The cost is one time for one year or for 5 years. If you need 50TB
for example, you can pay HPRC $6500 and we will provide the dedicated
50TB for 5 years.
